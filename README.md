 # Framework and background development language :
  
 - we choose flask as a framework since flask is best for small apps that could get big quickly.
  
 - We decide to choosing python for backend development, Having many advantages from the ease of
   learning to a large number of frameworks that simplify the development process, Python is often
   used for backend web application development. In addition, Python is well-equipped to work with 
   analytics, calculations, AI and ML, and statistics
